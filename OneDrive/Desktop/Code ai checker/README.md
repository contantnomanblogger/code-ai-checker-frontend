## Code AI Checker – Free Online AI Code Detector

Code AI Checker is a modern React-based web app that helps you analyze whether a code snippet was likely written by a **human** or generated by **AI** (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot), and gives an **originality-style score**.  
This repo contains the full frontend UI, basic heuristic engine, and report utilities so you can plug in your own AI or plagiarism APIs later.

### Features

- **AI code detection UI**
  - Large multi-language code input area (Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, MATLAB, and more).
  - Primary actions: **Check Code**, **Try Free Code Check**, and hero CTAs on the home page.
  - Loading spinner and smooth transitions for analysis.

- **Analysis output**
  - Confidence percentage like **“85% AI generated”**.
  - Clear label: **AI Generated** vs **Human Written**.
  - Short, human-readable **explanation** and a list of **key indicators** (comments usage, repetitiveness, formatting, etc.).
  - **Originality-style score** bar as a simple plagiarism/originality hint (stubbed, ready for integration).

- **Extra utilities**
  - **Copy result** to clipboard with one click.
  - **Share link stub** that encodes a lightweight result payload into a URL query string.
  - **Export as PDF**: a full analysis report plus the analyzed code, powered by `jsPDF`.
  - **Privacy notice**: clearly states that code is analyzed in-memory and not stored.

- **Pages & navigation**
  - `Home`: main detector UI (“Detect AI Generated Code Instantly”).
  - `How It Works`: step-by-step explanation and what is analyzed.
  - `FAQ`: at least 5 detailed FAQs about accuracy, privacy, supported languages, exporting, etc.
  - `Blog`: SEO-friendly posts like “code ai checker free”, “chatgpt code ai checker” (static cards).
  - `Contact`: simple contact form (name, email, message) plus social links and mailto.
  - Sticky header with navigation: **Home | How It Works | FAQ | Blog | Contact**.
  - Branded footer with © notice, quick links, and social icons.

- **Design**
  - Clean, modern, responsive layout with **dark/light mode** via a theme toggle.
  - Primary blue gradient brand color, soft dark backgrounds, rounded cards and buttons.
  - Smooth hover effects, shadows, and small entrance animations.

### Tech stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + React Router, Vite bundler.
- **Styling**: Plain CSS modules per page/component with CSS variables for theming.
- **Theming**: `ThemeContext` sets `data-theme="dark" | "light"` on `documentElement`, driving color tokens in `src/index.css`.
- **Reporting**: `jsPDF` for PDF export.

### Project structure (high level)

- `src/App.jsx` – top-level layout, routing, header + footer.
- `src/index.css` – global styles and CSS variables (dark/light theme).
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx` – dark/light mode toggle and persistence in `localStorage`.
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` – main detection UI, analysis logic, originality stub.
- `src/components/ResultDisplay.jsx` + `ResultDisplay.css` – result card, confidence gauge, indicators, originality bar, copy/share/PDF actions.
- `src/utils/resultUtils.js` – result formatting, clipboard utility, share-link stub, and PDF export.

### Running the project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL (by default `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

### Where to plug in your own AI / plagiarism engine

- The current analysis is a **simple heuristic stub** located in `src/pages/Home.jsx` inside `handleAnalyze`.
- To integrate a real model or API:

1. Replace the `setTimeout` block in `handleAnalyze` with an API call (e.g. `fetch` or `axios`) to your backend:
   - Send: the pasted `code`, optionally the selected `language`.
   - Receive: `isAI`, `confidence` (0–100), `explanation`, `indicators[]`, `originalityScore` (0–100).
2. Normalize your backend response into the same `result` shape currently used by `ResultDisplay`.
3. Keep the **privacy promise** by avoiding logging raw code on the backend unless users explicitly opt in.

### SEO & structured data

- **Title**: `Code AI Checker – Free Online AI Code Detector`.
- **Meta description**: describes AI vs human detection and originality-style checking.
- **Keywords**: include “code ai checker free”, “chatgpt code ai checker”, “code plagiarism ai checker”, etc.
- **Open Graph / Twitter**: tags in `index.html` for richer link previews.
- **Structured data**: JSON-LD `WebApplication` schema baked into `index.html` so search engines understand:
  - App name, URL, description, category, language, and feature list.

### Notes

- This repo intentionally focuses on a **fast, polished frontend** and a **pluggable detection layer**.
- The current logic and “originality” value are **not** real plagiarism detection—they’re placeholders.
- Feel free to fork and:
  - Swap the heuristic for a real LLM or classifier.
  - Connect to a commercial plagiarism API.
  - Extend blog content and FAQ for stronger SEO.

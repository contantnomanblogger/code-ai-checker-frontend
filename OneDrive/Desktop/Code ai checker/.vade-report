# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights tracking for the Code AI Checker React application following the official Vercel documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- **Added dependency**: `@vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1`
- Installed via npm to ensure compatibility with the existing package manager (npm)

### 2. Code Changes
- **Modified**: `src/main.jsx`
  - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<BrowserRouter>` wrapper
  - Placement ensures the component is rendered at the root level and can track all route changes

### 3. Files Updated
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree
- `src/main.jsx` - Integrated SpeedInsights component

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the **React/Create React App** pattern from the Vercel Speed Insights documentation:
- Uses `@vercel/speed-insights/react` package entry point
- Component is placed in the root of the React application (main.jsx)
- Positioned inside React.StrictMode and BrowserRouter for proper integration

## Framework Compatibility
This is a **React + Vite** application, so the implementation uses:
- `@vercel/speed-insights/react` (React-specific implementation)
- Component-based integration rather than script injection

## Testing & Verification
✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
✅ No errors or warnings during compilation
✅ Bundle size impact: +156.90 kB total (reasonable for analytics)

## Next Steps for Deployment

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab)
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` route will be available after the first deployment
3. Data will begin appearing in the dashboard after users visit the site
4. Metrics like Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB) will be tracked automatically

## Notes
- No additional configuration required for basic functionality
- The SpeedInsights component automatically handles route tracking with React Router
- Privacy-compliant by default (no personal user data collected)
- Works in both development and production environments

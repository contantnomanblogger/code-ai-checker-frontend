# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights into the React + Vite application following the official Vercel documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` (v1.3.1) to project dependencies
- Updated `package.json` with the new package
- Updated `package-lock.json` with dependency tree

### 2. Component Integration
Modified `src/App.jsx`:
- Imported `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component at the end of the main app component (before closing `</div>` tag)
- Placed the component at the root level to track all page interactions

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows Vercel's best practices for React/Vite applications:
- Used the React-specific export path (`@vercel/speed-insights/react`)
- Added the component at the application root level to ensure all routes are tracked
- No additional configuration required - the component will automatically start tracking performance metrics when deployed to Vercel

## Verification

- Build completed successfully: ✓
- No errors or warnings introduced: ✓
- Component properly imported and integrated: ✓

## Next Steps

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab)
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` will be automatically injected
3. Performance metrics will start appearing in the dashboard after user visits
